## Project Name: Beers in Town

#### Check In:

#### Progress made?
 I cleaned my groups data and set up routes to a group info page, I started displaying group data. I've finished pretty much all of my reducer tests and have written some other tests. I looked into the google maps api and I think I can make use of it.. I also gained access to untappds api and am looking for use in that.. I started styling my event cards and am playing around with color palletes... I've created all of my group components.

#### What deliverables still need to be completed from your last checkin?
I hit everything on the checklist, but I just need to continue plugging away at it, I need to make my proxy server work for me along with making that dang group thunk work haha

#### Next Steps?
Keep writing tests and review the other two apis I may bring in after prioritizing further what my minimum viable product is, I need to pick a color pallete and continue styling.. I need to make sass work I think I may have installed it incorrectly.

#### What are your concerns (if any)
Not a worry in the world!

#### Deliverables for next checkin:
